# Library Management System (LMS)

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! This project is designed to streamline library operations and provide an efficient way to manage books, members, and borrowing activities. The system follows an **object-oriented programming (OOP)** approach, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and security.

---

## üöÄ Features
### User Management
- **Secure Login System**: Passwords are securely hashed using SHA-256.
- **Role-Based Access**:
  - **Librarians**: Can manage books and view borrowing records of all members.
  - **Members**: Can borrow and return books, view their borrowing history, and pay fines.

### Library Operations
- **Librarian Functions**:
  - Add, update, or remove books.
  - View all borrowing records.
  - Manage overdue fines.
- **Member Functions**:
  - Borrow and return books.
  - View borrowing history.
  - Pay overdue fines.

### Additional Features
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid data entry.
- **Fine Management**: Calculates overdue fines automatically.
- **OOP Best Practices**: Abstract classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding.
